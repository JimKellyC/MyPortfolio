Jim-Kelly Clervoyant — Portfolio

This repository contains a small, modern portfolio site showcasing projects, skills and contact details.

Files:
- `index.html` — main HTML page
- `styles.css` — responsive, modern styles
- `script.js` — small scripts: project cards, mobile nav, theme toggle

How to run locally:

1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use a live server).
2. For development, you can use a simple static server. With PowerShell: 

```powershell
# from the repo root
npx http-server -c-1 .; # or use Live Server extension in VS Code
```

Notes:
- Theme preference is stored in `localStorage`.
- Edit `script.js` to add or change projects.

If you want, I can add more sections (blog, detailed project pages), or wire a contact form.
